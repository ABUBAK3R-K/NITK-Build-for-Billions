# Nirman Mitra: Product Requirements Document

**Team:** StrawHats · **Event:** Build for Billions · **Status:** Draft v1

---

## 1. Summary

**Problem.** Construction workers in India qualify for state welfare benefits only if they can prove days of work (typically 90 days in a year). That proof usually depends on a contractor's signature, which many workers cannot obtain.

**Product.** Nirman Mitra ("builder's friend") is a voice-first WhatsApp assistant that lets a worker build that proof themselves:
1. The worker checks in daily with a selfie, their location and a short voice note.
2. Each check-in is verified automatically.
3. When enough days are verified, the worker receives a **digitally signed work credential** with a QR code.
4. A welfare board officer scans the QR and verifies the signature **in the browser, without contacting our server**, then approves the claim.

**Positioning.**
- Aadhaar proves who you are, UPI moves money, and DigiLocker holds documents. Nothing proves what work you did.
- Nirman Mitra is a proof-of-work layer built on open credential standards and explicit consent.

## 2. Users

| User | Needs | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| **Construction worker** | Build verifiable proof of work days without a contractor; understand their progress; receive a credential | Low literacy, basic Android phone, WhatsApp already installed, intermittent network, prefers voice and their own language |
| **Welfare board officer** | Trust a worker's claim quickly; see the attendance summary behind it; approve or reject | Needs to verify at a counter or in the field; cannot depend on a vendor's server being up |
| **Program admin** | Monitor registrations and check-ins, review low-confidence check-ins, keep an audit trail | Must not see more personal data than needed |

---

## 3. The core user story (demo path)

1. **Consent.** A worker messages the bot and receives a short purpose notice **in Kannada** with an **"I agree"** button. Consent is recorded with a timestamp.
2. **Onboarding.** The worker says their name, photographs their Aadhaar card (only the last 4 digits are kept) and sends a selfie for enrollment.
3. **Daily check-in.** The worker sends a selfie, shares their location with the WhatsApp location button, and records a voice note about the day's work. The bot replies within seconds: verified, or sent for review.
4. **Credential.** On reaching the threshold (3 days in demo mode, 90 in production), the worker receives a **signed credential with a real QR code** on WhatsApp.
5. **Verification.** An officer opens the portal and scans the QR. The **signature is checked in the browser** against our published public key. The officer sees the attendance summary and taps **Approve**. The approval and every officer view are written to the audit log.

A task is in scope only if it makes this story work better.

## 4. Functional requirements

### FR-1 Consent (WhatsApp)
- Before any data is collected, send a purpose notice in the worker's language (Kannada, Hindi or English) with an interactive **I agree** reply button.
- Store a consent record: worker ID, notice version, language, timestamp, channel.
- Without consent, the bot collects no documents, images or voice.

### FR-2 Onboarding
- Detect the language from the first message; the worker can change it later.
- Capture the name by voice or text.
- **Aadhaar:**
  - OCR the card photo (Amazon Textract) and validate the number with the Verhoeff checksum.
  - **Store only the last 4 digits.** The full number is used in memory for validation and then discarded.
- **Face:** index the enrollment selfie (Amazon Rekognition) for later 1:1 comparison.
- **Image quality:** if a document image is poor, guide the worker by voice to retake it (up to 3 attempts, then flag for admin).

### FR-3 Daily check-in: triple verification
Three independent checks run **in parallel**:

| Check | Method | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Face | Rekognition CompareFaces against the enrolled selfie | Proxy check-ins, wrong person |
| Location | Haversine distance from the shared location to the nearest registered site geo-fence | Off-site check-ins |
| Voice intent | Speech-to-text, then an LLM judges whether the note describes real work at the site | Empty or scripted check-ins |

**Confidence routing:**

| Result | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Auto-approved** | Face ≥ 60 and geo ≥ 60 |
| **Rejected** | Face < 30, or distance beyond 2× the site radius |
| **Pending review** | Anything else; queued for an admin |

**Also flagged:** off-hours submissions (before 06:00 or after 20:00 IST) and non-work voice notes.

**Duplicates:** one check-in per worker per day.

**Reply:** text plus a spoken audio reply (Amazon Polly) with days logged and days remaining.

### FR-4 Signed work credential
- Issued automatically when verified days reach `CERTIFICATE_THRESHOLD`.
- **Format:** a JWT signed with **ES256**. Its claims include:
  - issuer DID
  - worker pseudonymous ID
  - name
  - Aadhaar last 4
  - verified day count
  - date range
  - site names
  - issue time
- **Issuer key:**
  - The public key is published as a **did:web** document on the portal's domain (`/.well-known/did.json`).
  - The private key never leaves the backend.
- **Delivery on WhatsApp:**
  - a **real QR code** encoding the portal URL `/verify#<token>` (the token sits in the URL fragment, so it never reaches a server log)
  - the PDF certificate
- The PDF keeps a SHA-256 fingerprint and a public verification link.

### FR-5 Officer verification portal
- Scan a QR with the phone or laptop camera, or paste a token.
- **In-browser verification:**
  - Resolve the issuer's did:web public key and verify the ES256 signature.
  - Check expiry.
  - No call to the Nirman Mitra API is needed to decide validity.
- Show the credential summary: worker name, Aadhaar last 4, verified days, date range, sites.
- **Approve** or **Reject** with an optional note. The decision is written to the audit log.
- **Target:** QR scan to "Verified" in under 5 seconds on a mid-range phone.

### FR-6 Admin dashboard
- Login with JWT access and refresh tokens. The seed endpoint requires a seed secret.
- Overview: workers, active or onboarding, days logged, pending reviews, trend charts.
- Review queue: flagged check-ins with reasons and per-signal confidence; approve or reject with justification.
- Worker search and profile, with the phone number masked.

### FR-7 Audit log
Append-only audit entries for:
- every officer view
- every approve and reject decision
- every admin view of a worker profile

Each entry records actor, action, subject, timestamp and outcome.

### FR-8 Languages
- Demo path: **Kannada, Hindi and English**.
- The roughly 15 Kannada strings on the demo path are hand-translated and checked by a native speaker.

## 5. Non-functional requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Latency | Check-in reply target: a few seconds, measured end to end before quoting any number. Credential verification under 5 s |
| Privacy | Data minimisation: Aadhaar last 4 only; the phone number is masked in admin views; no Aadhaar image or number is ever sent to an LLM |
| Security | Webhook requests authenticated with Meta's `X-Hub-Signature-256`; admin API behind JWT; secrets only in deployment parameters or secret stores, never in the repository; S3 encryption at rest (SSE-S3) |
| Compliance | Aligned with the DPDP Act 2023: explicit consent, stated purpose, audit trail, deletion on request (roadmap) |
| Accessibility | The whole worker flow is completable by voice and buttons; spoken replies for every status message |
| Cost | Serverless and pay-per-use; idle cost near zero; an honest per-worker cost estimate is published with its working |
| Reliability | Duplicate-safe check-ins; webhook acknowledges receipt even when downstream processing fails, and errors are logged |

## 7. Scope for this build

| Piece | Scope | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Signed credential | ES256 JWT, did:web document, real QR to `/verify#<token>` | Wasih |
| Officer portal | QR scan, in-browser signature check, attendance summary, approve action, audit display | Abubaker |
| Consent + audit log | WhatsApp consent button with purpose notice, consent record, audit entry on every officer/admin view | Shehzan / Wasih |
| Kannada | The demo-path strings, native-speaker checked | Hasan / Shehzan |
| Faster speech-to-text | Groq Whisper instead of batch transcription, **2-hour timebox**; revert if it overruns | Shehzan |
| Hardening | Restrict test keywords to team numbers, production configuration, remove fallback transcription, ~10 unit tests | Wasih |

---

## 8. Out of scope (roadmap)

- Bhashini speech services and languages beyond Kannada, Hindi and English
- e-Shram UAN linkage and DigiLocker issuance
- Site supervisor interface (co-signing check-ins)
- Liveness detection
- Credential revocation (status list)
- Workflow orchestration with Step Functions
- Direct integration with welfare board systems

---

## 9. Success criteria

- A credential issued on WhatsApp verifies in the portal **with no server call**.
- An officer goes from scan to "Verified" in **under 5 seconds**.
- A new worker sees the consent notice in Kannada, and the check-in reply arrives quickly (time measured and reported as measured).
- Every officer or admin view appears in the audit log.

---

## 10. Communication rules

- **Claims:** state only what works at the time of saying it.
  - Languages: "Kannada, Hindi and English today".
  - Verification speed: quote only measured times.
- **Numbers:** every statistic used in the pitch must have a citable source (§11); a number without a source is dropped.
